        <p>I won't bore you with anything lengthy, but here is my "<b>manifesto</b>" as it's typically called, condensed into a few bulletpoints.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
	<p><b>1. I'll Let Serenity Be My Compass</b> "The waves of life crash against the shores of my spirit, yet I stand serene. I embrace the power of knowing what I can change and surrendering to what I cannot. This serenity is not passivity, but a focused calm that directs my actions towards what truly matters: making a difference where I can."</p>
        <br>
	<p><b>2. I'll Love Without Measure</b> "My heart is an open door, extending love and compassion without expectation of return. In the spirit of the greatest commandments, I seek to love others as I love myself, finding in this selfless love the path to true fulfillment and joy in service to the greater good."</p>
        <br>
	<p><b>3. We Embrace Effortless Action (Wu Wei)</b> "In the flow of life, I align myself with the Dao, the way of effortless action. By doing so, I act not with force, but with grace, letting my deeds emerge naturally from a place of inner peace and purpose. This is how I navigate the world, effortlessly yet purposefully, contributing to the harmony around me."</p>
	<br>        
	<p><b>4. I Cultivate Inner Harmony for Outer Impact <i>"My journey inward is not an escape from the world but a preparation to engage with it more deeply. By seeking harmony within myself, I am better equipped to bring balance and peace to others. My actions, therefore, are reflections of my inner state: calm, deliberate, and aligned with the greater good."</p>
        <br>
	<p><b>5. I Live as a Testament to Time Well Spent <i>"I cherish time as the canvas of life's masterpiece. Each moment is an opportunity to contribute, to learn, and to love. In dedicating myself to the service of others, I find the most profound use of my time, crafting a legacy not of material achievements, but of lives touched and improved."</p>
